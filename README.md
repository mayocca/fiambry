Are you working at somewhere with a lot of people? And everyday, someone is in charge of ordering food for everyone?

_"Yeah, 1 apple, 2 bananas, 1 pear, 2 more apples... Wait, no, did they want two bananas for both, or each one? How many apples was it again? Why did Tom ask for two oranges in the group chat even though he didn't come to work today?"_

Fiambry is a web application to create and manage orders. Just create an order, share the link with your colleagues, and let them add their own items. No more confusion, no more mistakes.
